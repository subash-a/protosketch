Protosketch
===========

It is a web based application for converting hand drawn sketches into interactive prototype web pages. The hand drawn sketches can also be drawn using a stencil for which the template can be found in the assets folder. This template can be cut out from a piece of card and used to trace out the component outlines. Once fed into the system, the sketch would get converted into a web page with html and javascript components. 

In order to run the code found on this repository you will need to have OpenCV installed on your system, you can do the same by following the steps below

1. Download the lastest version of OpenCV from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/)
2. Unzip the OpenCV zip or tarball 
3. Go to the folder containing the unzipped OpenCV folder and run the install_opencv.sh script
